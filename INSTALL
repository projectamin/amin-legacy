Installing Amin should be easy to do.

Please read this entire document before
typing anything. 

To install Amin you should only need to type

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

You will also need to answer the questions
when prompted. Amin installs many other perl
modules. Those modules will ask their own 
questions. 

***NOTE***

If you have never configured CPAN before on your 
system, you may be asked CPAN configuration questions.
Usually you can just hit enter(ie accept the default
configurations). Some questions though require input,
ie setting up cpan mirrors closest to you. 

Also it is best to NOT install CPANPLUS if you have
never done so before....

***END NOTE***

The make process above should install all the dependency
modules that Amin requires. If it fails you could
always install them manually. Here is a list of
needed modules. If you have a newer version of any
module that is acceptable. 

Name => 'version'
-----------------
Cwd => '2.04',
IPC::Run => '0.74',
URI => '1.22',
XML::SAX::Base => '1.02',
XML::NamespaceSupport' => '0.03',
XML::SAX => '0.12',
XML::Generator::PerlData => '0.87',
XML::SAX::ParserFactory => '1.01',
XML::Filter::XInclude => '1.0',
HTML::Tagset => '3.03',
HTML::HeadParser => '2.17',
LWP => '5.65',
Sort::Naturally => '1.01',
XML::SAX::PurePerl

These are recommended

Sys::Hostname
Net::Daemon => '0.37',
Crypt::Blowfish_PP => '1.12'
IPC::Shareable
Net::SMTP
IO::Socket

Good Luck. ;)
